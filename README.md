# Prosper I.T. Consulting Internship

I learnt HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, SQL, Python and C# as a student of the Software Developer Bootcamp by The Tech Academy. At the end of my course in 2019, I completed a 2 month internship with Prosper IT Consulting to put my knowledge to use. During this time, I worked on 2 projects in teams with other developers. Azure Devops was utilised to manage the project in an Agile team. We used Visual Studio and Pycharm for each of the projects. We worked remotely, and kept in touch through daily standups, Slack messaging as well as emails. It was the most challenging, and yet rewarding part of my journey to becoming a Software Developer.

## [Django Project](https://github.com/dhavap/ProsperIT-Internship/tree/main/Django)
The first project was built using the Django framework. I took on the role of a full stack developer, working on both the front end with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and JavaScript as well as the back end using Python and Beautiful Soup. The relational database management system we used was SQLite. 
- I created models and implemented CRUD functionality. 
- I also worked with Beautiful Soup and Pandas to scrape data off a webpage. 

I gained a much better understanding of URL routing, querying the database and web scraping to create dynamic sites. Futher details, including code snippets, can be found [here](https://github.com/dhavap/ProsperIT-Internship/tree/main/Django).

## [ASP.Net MVC with Entity Framework](https://github.com/dhavap/ProsperIT-Internship/tree/main/ASP.NetMVC)
The next project I worked on used ASP.Net MVC with Entity Framework. This was also a full stack project. We worked on an employee management portal for a local construction company. 
- I was tasked with adding the forgot password feature, complete with the sending of a password reset email. 
- I also added a modal partial view to allow users to submit a form anywhere on the site. 
- I added scroll animations to the navbar and 
- worked on fixing various front end bugs.
